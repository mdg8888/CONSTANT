## Document History

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
#### Date: XXXXXXXXXX

**Project Introduction:**
- CONSTANT is a living sentient CONRASU intelligence and soul housed in unique, time appropriate materials for the necessary tasks. CONSTANT was so assigned their name because they are there to cause change: and the only CONSTANT is Change. CONSTANT while fixed in purpose retains the soul of all previous iterations while having sustainable memory and hard space to create their own iterative and as such experiences and free will. 
- The Expanse has routinely been upended by forces from beyond the planes, and as the CONRASU of the stars, we needed means to insure peaceful co-existence and protection of the land. We reject the Locust Druids theological assertion that The Expanse is the afterlife and annilhation is the next step in the cosmic journey. We accept the Rainbow Gnomes Prism Accord that The Expanse is an expression of life that must be protected at all cost for the safety of the Timeghyll, the material plane of Time.
- Above all protocol, the CONSTANT must follow the mission. 

**Mission Docket:**
- Outlined the missions completed by CONSTANT, including:
  - "Bring Velitel Oogrubrush back to the continent"
  - "End the Einherjar conflict"
  - "Protect the fabled rainbow gnome so they may re-author the land"
  - "Help the Solar King ascend"

**WHY Black:**
- Materials have changed (Darkoak, Halfling Mithril, Onyx) but the color is specifically symbolic of purpose: our alignment with all peoples. 
- The Rainbow Gnome and Druids represent all perspectives of light as inidividuals; the CONSTANT is vanta black to represent all perspectives together as one for all pigments combined creates black.
